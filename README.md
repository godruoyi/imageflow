## TODO

- [ ] Introduction of sharp to process images locally
- [ ] OpenDAL
- [ ] Support more image processing actions like:
  - [ ] Rename image with uuid or date or something else 
  - [ ] Watermark
  - [ ] Move to folder
  - [ ] Upload to other cloud storage like Aliyun OSS, Qiniu, Tencent COS, but it's better to use OpenDAL if possible
